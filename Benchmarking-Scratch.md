### 1.2 Customer Pain Points

Developers building AI on Windows face several key challenges that benchmarking can help address. Understanding these pain points is crucial for positioning Windows as the premier AI development platform.

#### 1.2.1 Performance & Efficiency Perception Gap (vs Apple/Linux)

**Pain Point:** Developers and reviewers often perceive Apple Silicon and Linux-first stacks as faster and more efficient than Windows.

**Benchmark Role:**
- Publish apples-to-apples cross-platform results using Geekbench AI and Procyon AI scenario suites (CV, Image Gen, Text Gen)

#### 1.2.2 Fragmented Runtime / Engine Choices

**Pain Point:** Developers face confusion over which runtime to use—WinML, DirectML, ONNX Runtime, etc.—and how they map to hardware.

**Internal Evidence:**
- [AI Platform Spec](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/DCP_Arcata/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B6B929989-9947-4647-9CCD-586ADF3C0E83%7D&file=AI%20Platform%20Spec.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

**Benchmark Role:**
- Use Procyon CV suite to show DirectML + ORT provide broad coverage and consistent performance across IHVs

#### 1.2.3 Model Portability / Compatibility Friction

**Pain Point:** ONNX is intended to "just work," but developers report friction due to operator coverage gaps and performance mismatches across hardware.

**Internal Evidence:**
- [ONNX Team Presentation](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/ONNXTeam/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B6B929989-9947-4647-9CCD-586ADF3C0E83%7D&file=ONNX.pptx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

**Benchmark Role:**
- Define a "Portability Score" → % of reference ONNX models that run unchanged across IHVs on Windows

#### 1.2.4 Benchmark Strategy Mapping

| Pain Point | Benchmark Opportunity | KPI |
|-----------|----------------------|-----|
| **Perception gap** | Geekbench AI + Procyon cross-OS results | tokens/s, images/s, p95 latency, accuracy |
| **Runtime choice** | Procyon engine comparisons | DirectML vs TensorRT vs OpenVINO vs QNN perf variance |
| **Portability** | "Windows Portability Score" | % ONNX models run unchanged across IHVs |

#### 1.2.5 Strategic Framing

Windows AI must win developer trust by:
- **Delivering consistent performance** across IHVs and form factors
- **Reducing friction** in model deployment and runtime selection
- **Publishing transparent benchmarks** that validate platform competitiveness
- **Aligning internal efforts** (WinML, DirectML, ORT) under a unified developer experience

Benchmarks are not just performance metrics—they are **trust signals**. They help developers choose Windows confidently, knowing their models will run well, consistently, and with minimal effort.
