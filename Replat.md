## Replat Architecture

### High Level Architecture Diagram
Replat fundamentally transforms how ONNX Runtime (ORT) execution providers (EPs) are distributed and utilized within the Windows ecosystem. Traditionally, ORT clients have been required to bundle execution providers as part of their application packages, creating deployment complexity and increasing package sizes.

With Replat's integration into Windows ML, this paradigm shifts significantly. Windows ML becomes a system-level service available through the Windows App SDK package via the Microsoft Store. The platform intelligently detects the underlying hardware configuration and dynamically provisions the appropriate execution provider UUP (Unified Update Platform) packages for optimal performance.

This architectural evolution enables consuming applications to operate without embedding execution providers directly. Instead, they can dynamically request execution resources, including local NPU acceleration, through the Windows ML interface. This approach reduces application complexity, minimizes deployment overhead, and ensures optimal hardware utilization across diverse Windows device configurations.
