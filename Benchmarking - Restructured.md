# Windows AI Benchmarking Strategy
## Executive Brief & Action Plan

---

## Executive Summary

**Windows NPUs (45 TOPS) and diverse silicon outpace Apple's specs, but developer trust lags. Benchmarks must close this perception gap.**

**Goal:** Prove Windows beats Apple in real-world AI performance through repeatable benchmarks—UL Procyon AI CV 2.0 and MLPerf Client 1.5. Target: ≥5% NPU advantage over Apple M4, WinML within 5% of native performance across 7 models. Timeline: End 2025.

**Why Now:** Windows leads on paper but trails in perception. Procyon and MLPerf launch Q4 '24—our window to reshape the narrative with data.

**Strategy:** Demonstrate NPU superiority (Intel PTL, AMD GRG, QC CAS), prove silicon diversity advantage, validate WinML as unified execution layer. Success = measurable developer confidence improvement by Q1 2026.

### P0 Execution Plan

**Prove Windows dominance through targeted benchmarks:**

1. **Procyon AI CV 2.0**: Enable WinML on 45 TOPS NPUs (Intel PTL, AMD GRG, QC CAS). Target ≥5% advantage over Apple M4 MacBook Air across 5 vision models to demonstrate silicon superiority and prove "Windows NPUs outperform Apple in real-world vision tasks."

2. **MLPerf Client 1.5**: Enable WinML for dual GPU+NPU execution paths across 2 language models. Hero GPU device beats Apple M4 while NPU path demonstrates execution diversity, proving "Windows enables AI workloads across diverse GPU and NPU silicon."

3. **WinML Consistency Target**: Achieve ≤5% performance gap between WinML and native execution across both benchmark suites (7 total models) to validate WinML as the unified abstraction layer with AITK + Olive toolchain integration for reproducibility.

**Timeline**: Original target was Ignite 11/21, but execution is likely to slip by a few weeks given the challenges in resourcing the workstream and the long runway to go. The hope is to complete the enablement by end of calendar '25.

### How We'll Measure Success
| Metric | Target | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| UL Procyon AI CV 2.0 NPU score vs Apple M4 | >5% advantage | End of 2025 |
| MLPerf Client consistency (WinML vs native) | <5% performance gap | End of 2025 |
| DXI or some related developer confidence index | Measurable improvement | Q1 2026 |

Prioritize 2 benchmark partnerships (MLPerf + Procyon AI), unify WinML messaging, optimize runtime consistency across IHVs.

## 2. Benchmarking as the Differentiator

**Key Insight:** Every customer claim needs measurable proof—benchmarks transform technical specs into market credibility.

### Strategic Messaging Framework

| **Customer Message** | **Benchmark Validation** | **Strategic Impact** |
|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **"Windows NPUs outperform Apple in real-world vision tasks"** | UL Procyon AI CV 2.0 | Direct Apple compete using NPU-only workloads |
| **"Windows enables AI across diverse GPU and NPU silicon"** | MLPerf Client 1.5 (dual paths) | Hero GPU beats Apple M4; NPU shows execution flexibility |
| **"Any model, any processor—Windows vs Apple's restrictions"** | Custom power benchmark | Prove superior efficiency and developer choice |

### The WinML Value Proposition
**Strategic Advantage**: WinML enables "any model, any NPU" deployment across Windows' diverse silicon ecosystem. Developers can bring custom fine-tuned models directly to NPU execution across Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm platforms, while Apple's approved-list approach forces non-sanctioned models into power-hungry GPU execution with no developer override.

**WinML Delivers**:
- **Universal Model Support**: Deploy any ONNX model to NPU while Apple restricts access to approved models only
- **Silicon Diversity**: Target Intel, AMD, Qualcomm NPUs (45+ TOPS) vs Apple's single architecture constraint
- **Developer Control**: Explicit hardware targeting vs Apple's opaque fallback decisions
- **Efficiency Advantage**: NPU execution for custom models that Apple forces to inefficient GPU paths

**Proof Point**: Procyon AI CV 2.0 and MLPerf Client 1.5 results showing WinML achieving ≥95% of native performance across 7 reference models (5 vision + 2 language) and diverse silicon execution paths - proving consistent deployment across Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm platforms while Apple's approved-list restricts developers to GPU fallback for custom models.

### Power Efficiency Opportunity
**Apple's Hidden Weakness**: Apple restricts NPU access to an "approved list"—custom models fall back to power-hungry GPU execution without developer control. Windows enables NPU targeting for any ONNX model.

**Strategic Advantage**: 
- **Broader NPU Access**: WinML runs custom models on NPU while Apple forces GPU fallback
- **Developer Control**: Explicit execution path targeting vs Apple's opaque restrictions  
- **Performance Optimization**: High-performance mode maximizes NPU utilization for competitive scenarios

**Approach**: Power benchmarks comparing identical models:
- Windows NPU (high-performance mode) vs Apple GPU fallback for non-approved models
- Battery drain across sustained inference workloads  
- Real-world efficiency in custom AI scenarios (fine-tuned models, emerging use cases)

Target: Demonstrate superior power efficiency for custom models that Apple can't run on NPU.

### Open Issues Requiring Leadership Decision

#### **Open #1: AMD Engagement Gap**
**Status**: AMD owes response on benchmarking commitment since August EBR, but meetings continue to be rescheduled.

**Impact**: Without AMD participation, multi-IHV validation story becomes Intel + Qualcomm only, undermining ecosystem breadth claims and competitive positioning vs Apple's "choice" messaging.

**Decision Required**: 
- **Option A**: Launch Procyon/MLPerf with Intel + Qualcomm only, accept weaker ecosystem story
- **Option B**: Push timeline to secure AMD commitment, risk missing Ignite window

**Recommendation**: Option A with fallback messaging prepared - "Windows supports all IHV partners when ready"

#### **Open #2: Qualcomm MLPerf Performance Gap**
**Status**: Qualcomm GPU execution underperforms expectations. QC requests graph splitting + hybrid GPU+NPU execution but ORT lacks this capability.

**Impact**: QC would need to develop custom recipe/toolchain. Without this, QC GPU scores will be suboptimal in MLPerf submissions.

**Decision Required**:
- **Option A**: Launch MLPerf with current QC GPU performance (suboptimal scores)
- **Option B**: Delay until QC develops graph splitting solution

**Recommendation**: Option A - MLPerf focuses on execution diversity and QC won't be hero device. Intel/NVIDIA can carry competitive claims while QC demonstrates NPU flexibility.

#### **Open #3: Benchmark Prioritization if Serialization Required**
**Status**: Resource constraints may force serialization of benchmark workstreams to deliver one by end of calendar 2024.

**Impact**: If we can only execute one benchmark thoroughly rather than both in parallel, we need clear prioritization criteria to maximize strategic impact.

**Decision Required**:
- **Option A**: Prioritize **Procyon AI CV 2.0** - Direct NPU competitive win, simpler execution path, clearer Apple comparison
- **Option B**: Prioritize **MLPerf Client 1.5** - Industry standard credibility, broader silicon story, enterprise validation

**Decision Needed**: Requires evaluation of lead times for each benchmark and input from Marketing and Leadership on strategic preference. Key factors to assess:
- **Lead time analysis**: Which benchmark can realistically deliver by end of calendar 2024?
- **Marketing preference**: Direct competitive narrative (Procyon) vs industry credibility (MLPerf)?
- **Leadership priority**: NPU-focused story vs broader silicon diversity positioning?

### Detailed Competitive Analysis

#### Apple vs Windows AI Performance Comparison
Windows IHV partners (Intel, AMD, Qualcomm) all deliver superior NPU hardware with ~45 TOPS versus Apple's 38, yet the competitive reality is more complex. Apple's vertically integrated stack delivers consistent performance across their hardware—they control the entire experience. Windows operates across a fragmented ecosystem requiring continuous IHV coordination: identifying performance gaps, resolving regressions, and aligning optimization priorities across multiple vendors. Where Apple achieves predictable results, Windows must actively manage multi-vendor consistency. This coordination overhead is both our challenge and our opportunity—benchmarking becomes the forcing function to align the ecosystem and prove that superior silicon diversity can match Apple's integrated approach.

#### Customer Pain Points Analysis
**Performance & Efficiency Perception Gap**: Windows is often perceived as slower or less efficient than Apple Silicon or Linux-first stacks, even when real-world performance has improved significantly. For example, Photoshop on Windows started ~30% behind Apple M2 but reached parity by early 2025.

**Fragmented Runtime & Engine Choices**: Developers face confusion over which runtime to use—WinML, DirectML, ONNX Runtime—and how each maps to hardware. This fragmentation creates friction in onboarding and deployment.

**Model Portability & Compatibility Friction**: ONNX is designed to "just work," but developers often encounter operator coverage gaps and performance mismatches across hardware.

#### Developer Requirements Analysis
Beyond performance, developers prioritize:
- **Ease of Development**: Fast setup and minimal friction ("just works" experience)
- **Performance**: Raw power across diverse workloads while maintaining efficiency
- **Tooling & Ecosystem**: Rich IDEs and framework support with better discoverability
- **Hardware Integration**: Competitive, scalable, and developer-friendly platform positioning

### Silicon Roadmap Deep Dive

#### Market Context & Trends
The global AI silicon market is projected to reach **$154 billion by 2030** with a CAGR exceeding 20% [ToDo: CITATION NEEDED]. Industry leaders—including NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Google—are rapidly converging toward unified architectures that blend traditional GPU programmability with dedicated AI accelerators such as NPUs and custom ASICs, driven by explosive demand for generative AI and edge computing.

#### Hardware Architecture Evolution
Hybrid CPU+NPU+GPU designs are becoming standard for next-generation devices [ToDo: VERIFY ACROSS ALL IHVs], enabling new execution paths and resource tradeoffs that fundamentally reshape benchmarking strategies. Edge AI chips and specialized SoCs are forecast to grow more than 20% year-over-year in 2025 [ToDo: CITATION NEEDED], reflecting the shift from centralized datacenter inference to distributed, real-time intelligence at the device level.

#### Strategic Implications
Microsoft's strategy positions WinML as the unifying abstraction layer that solves IHV fragmentation—developers write once to WinML while native paths enable IHV-specific optimization and validation. With unified IR and MLIR architectures, WinML promises consistent abstraction and apples-to-apples comparisons across hardware targets, positioning Windows uniquely against vertically integrated competitors.

### Full Benchmarking Landscape

#### Problem Context & Strategic Purpose
Windows AI operates across a fragmented ecosystem of IHVs, runtimes, and hardware configurations. Unlike Apple's tightly integrated stack, this complexity makes consistency and clarity harder to achieve. Benchmarking serves as a strategic bridge—not just a scorecard—to:
- Demonstrate parity and leadership across platforms
- Shift narrative from raw TOPS to portability, predictability, and efficiency  
- Clarify execution paths across NPU, GPU, and CPU
- Surface the value of local compute in performance, developer control, and consistency

#### Power Efficiency Challenge
Internal Intel benchmarking shows Geekbench AI 1.4 delivered only a 1.4× performance uplift while consuming 5.8× more NPU power and 2.4× more SoC power. This imbalance highlights a critical gap: performance gains are not scaling efficiently with power consumption. Apple's M4 achieves 3–4× better performance-per-watt, reinforcing its reputation for silent, efficient AI compute.

#### Real-World Inference Requirements
Enterprise feedback indicates local AI performance often feels slower than cloud alternatives. Benchmarks must reflect:
- Latency under realistic conditions
- Execution path transparency (NPU vs GPU vs CPU)  
- Developer experience metrics like model accessibility and deployment friction
