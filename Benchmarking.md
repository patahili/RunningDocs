## Introduction
AI benchmarking is a nascent and rapidly evolving space. MLPerf, one of the most recognized benchmarking consortia, only launched its v1.0 client-side benchmarks as recently as September 2025. Benchmarking vendors are not only defining the key performance indicators (KPIs) that underpin these evaluations, but also adapting to the growing complexity of AI workloads—ranging from convolution-heavy imaging models to transformer-based language models. This white paper explores the "what" and "why" of AI benchmarks, followed by a more tactical "how" and "when." For Windows, the mission of AI benchmarking must align with WinML's goals for the developer ecosystem, the competitive landscape shaped by Apple's vertically integrated hardware/software stack, and the evolving silicon roadmap. Benchmarking must complement these areas to ensure relevance, impact, and strategic alignment.

Benchmarks are standardized tests designed to evaluate the performance of AI models and systems. They measure aspects like speed, accuracy, throughput, latency, and efficiency across different hardware and software configurations. Benchmarks are critical for validating AI readiness, guiding optimization, and showcasing platform competitiveness.
In platform development and silicon bring-up, benchmarking enables consistent, data-driven evaluation of model execution across diverse hardware architectures. It supports validation of execution stacks (e.g., WinML, OpenVINO, Native), tracks performance shifts from firmware and driver updates, and informs engineering decisions around power and efficiency. Benchmarks help isolate bottlenecks across CPU, GPU, and NPU, guide compiler and quantization improvements, and monitor readiness across model conversion and deployment workflows. In collaborative efforts—such as Microsoft's engagements with Intel and Qualcomm—benchmarks align engineering priorities, validate new silicon features like DSP Queuing, and accelerate enablement across Surface and OEM platforms.

Strategically, benchmarking provides a trusted and universally accepted framework for performance evaluation. It replaces ambiguous metrics like TOPS, which often fail to reflect real-world behavior and vary widely in implementation. By relying on clearly defined and agreed-upon metrics, benchmarks enable meaningful competitive analysis and cross-platform comparisons. Critically, they also serve as a source of truth for developers—building trust in the platform's capabilities and accelerating AI development on Windows. As Microsoft positions itself against vertically integrated competitors like Apple, benchmarking becomes a strategic lever to showcase the strength of the Windows ecosystem, powered by a diverse set of NPUs and silicon partners. It informs architectural decisions, guides optimization, and helps align cross-industry expectations, ultimately driving platform adoption and developer confidence.

## 1. Strategic Context & Market Analysis

This section explores the competitive landscape, customer segments, and how benchmarking can serve as a strategic lever—not just a technical tool. In this context, "customers" refers primarily to reviewers, commercial buyers, and institutional entities (e.g., schools, research labs) whose decisions shape platform adoption. The average consumer is influenced more by the choices developers and commercial entities make—such as which features are available or which hardware is supported—than by raw performance specs.

### Key Takeaways – Benchmarks are Vehicles to Advertise WinML and Windows as the Place to Build AI

Windows AI isn't just competing on benchmark scores—it's competing for developer trust. Apple's strength lies in its seamless, vertically integrated experience that "just works," while Windows spans a diverse ecosystem of IHVs, runtimes, and hardware configurations. This fragmentation creates friction—but also unlocks scale, flexibility, and reach.

To close the gap, benchmarking must evolve from a scorecard into a strategic clarity tool. It should validate real-world performance (e.g., UL Procyon), establish enterprise credibility (e.g., MLPerf), and shift the narrative from raw TOPS to portability, predictability, and scenario realism. Benchmarks are trust signals—they help developers navigate complexity and confidently choose Windows as their AI platform.

This section outlines the competitive landscape, prioritizes high-value customer segments, and maps developer pain points to actionable benchmarking strategies. It highlights ISVs, app developers, and OEMs/IHVs as top priorities—and shows how benchmarking can unify the developer experience, close perception gaps, and position Windows as the preferred platform for building AI—not by outmuscling Apple on specs, but by being better where it matters most: developer experience, reach, and reliability.

## 1.1 Competitive Snapshot: Apple vs Windows AI

To understand where Windows stands today, it's important to first examine the competitive landscape. Apple continues to set the benchmark for AI performance and developer experience through its tightly integrated hardware-software stack. The M4 chip, paired with Core ML and the Neural Engine, delivers high efficiency and strong benchmark scores across real-world workloads. In contrast, Windows AI—powered by Snapdragon X Elite and the WinML + Olive + ONNX Runtime stack—is still evolving, but shows promising signs of competitiveness.

While Qualcomm's NPU leads on paper with 45 TOPS versus Apple's 38, benchmark results tell a more nuanced story. Apple consistently outperforms in Geekbench AI and UL Procyon scenario tests, especially in quantized and image-based inference. Efficiency per TOPS also favors Apple, thanks to its mature stack. However, Windows is closing the gap, with internal data showing performance parity in key apps like Photoshop and ongoing improvements in MLPerf client benchmarks.

### **Strategic Implications for Windows Benchmarking**

To compete effectively, Windows must shift the narrative from raw specs to real-world performance. Benchmarking should:

- Highlight Windows' theoretical NPU advantage (45 TOPS) in Copilot+ PCs

## **1.3 Customer Pain Points**

Developers building AI on Windows face a set of recurring challenges that benchmarking can help address. These pain points are not just technical—they shape perception, influence platform choice, and ultimately determine whether developers invest in Windows as their AI development environment.

### **Performance & Efficiency Perception Gap**

Windows is often perceived as slower or less efficient than Apple Silicon or Linux-first stacks. This perception is reinforced by reviewers and benchmark results, even when real-world performance has improved significantly. For example, Photoshop on Windows started ~30% behind Apple M2 but reached parity by early 2025. To shift this narrative, Windows must publish apples-to-apples results using cross-platform suites like Geekbench AI and UL Procyon.

### **Fragmented Runtime & Engine Choices**

Developers face confusion over which runtime to use—WinML, DirectML, ONNX Runtime—and how each maps to hardware. This fragmentation creates friction in onboarding and deployment. Benchmarking can help clarify the landscape by showing consistent performance across engines and IHVs, using scenario-based suites like Procyon CV.

### **Model Portability & Compatibility Friction**

ONNX is designed to "just work," but developers often encounter operator coverage gaps and performance mismatches across hardware. A portability score—measuring how many reference models run unchanged across IHVs—can help quantify and address this issue. Benchmarks should highlight where Windows excels and where gaps remain.

### **Benchmark Strategy Mapping**

Each pain point maps to a clear benchmarking opportunity:
- **Perception gap** → Geekbench AI + Procyon cross-OS results
- **Runtime confusion** → Engine comparisons across DirectML, TensorRT, OpenVINO, QNN
- **Portability friction** → Windows Portability Score (% of ONNX models that run unchanged)

---

## **1.4 What Developers Are Looking For**

Beyond performance, developers care about ease of development, tooling, and hardware integration. Public sentiment reveals four key areas where Windows can improve or differentiate:

- **Ease of Development**: Developers want fast setup and minimal friction. Apple is praised for its "just works" experience. Windows has an opportunity to simplify onboarding and unify runtimes.
- **Performance**: While Apple wins on efficiency, Windows offers raw power across diverse workloads. Benchmarks should showcase this strength.
- **Tooling & Ecosystem**: Developers value rich IDEs and framework support. VS Code is universally loved, but Windows-native tools like WinML and ONNX need better discoverability.
- **Hardware Integration**: Apple's tight hardware-software synergy sets a high bar. Windows must position Copilot+ PCs and its NPU ecosystem as competitive, scalable, and developer-friendly.

## 3. Silicon Roadmap & Hardware Landscape

The global AI silicon market is at an inflection point, projected to reach **$154 billion by 2030** with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) exceeding 20%. Industry leaders—including NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Google—are rapidly converging toward unified architectures that blend traditional GPU programmability with dedicated AI accelerators such as NPUs and custom ASICs. This transformation is driven by explosive demand for generative AI, edge computing, and hybrid workloads that span CPU, GPU, and NPU resources.

Hybrid CPU+NPU+GPU designs are now the default for next-generation devices, enabling new execution paths and resource tradeoffs that fundamentally reshape benchmarking strategies. Edge AI chips and specialized SoCs are forecast to grow more than 20% year-over-year in 2025, reflecting the shift from centralized datacenter inference to distributed, real-time intelligence at the device level.

As the competitive landscape intensifies, benchmarking must evolve to capture system-level performance, portability, and developer experience—not just isolated IP throughput. Microsoft's strategy is to enable dual execution paths (native and WinML) across all IHVs, with unified IR and MLIR architectures promising consistent abstraction and apples-to-apples comparisons across hardware targets.

In this rapidly changing environment, benchmarking is more than a scorecard—it is a strategic lever for building developer trust, enabling portability, and showcasing the strength of the Windows ecosystem against vertically integrated competitor.

## 4. Benchmarking Landscape & Rationale

### 🔍 Problem Context

Windows AI operates across a fragmented ecosystem of IHVs, runtimes, and hardware configurations. Unlike Apple's tightly integrated stack, this complexity makes consistency and clarity harder to achieve. Benchmarking must therefore serve as a strategic bridge — not just a scorecard.

Benchmarks help:

*   Demonstrate parity and leadership across platforms
*   Shift the narrative from raw TOPS to portability, predictability, and efficiency
*   Clarify execution paths across NPU, GPU, and CPU
*   Surface the value of local compute — not just in performance, but in developer control and consistency

They are essential tools for building trust with developers, validating platform maturity, and guiding optimization efforts across the stack.

### 🔋 Power Efficiency: The Strategic Gap

In internal benchmarking conducted by Intel, Geekbench AI 1.4 delivered only a 1.4× performance uplift while consuming 5.8× more NPU power and 2.4× more SoC power. This imbalance highlights a critical gap: performance gains are not scaling efficiently with power. In contrast, Apple's M4 achieves 3–4× better performance-per-watt, reinforcing its reputation for silent, efficient AI compute.

To close this gap, Windows must evolve its benchmarking approach to reflect power efficiency as a first-class metric. This includes:

*   Power-normalized metrics (e.g., latency-per-watt, TOPS/W)
*   Compiler and runtime behavior that scales efficiently across silicon
*   Scenario-based profiling to highlight real-world efficiency

***

### ⚡ Real-World Inference & Execution Clarity

Enterprise feedback shows local AI performance often feels slower than cloud alternatives. Benchmarks must reflect:

*   Latency under realistic conditions
*   Execution path transparency (NPU vs GPU vs CPU)
*   Developer experience metrics like model accessibility and deployment friction

Benchmarks should help developers understand not just how fast a model runs — but where, why, and how consistently.

## 5. Strategic Framing and Benchmark-driven messaging

Strategic benchmark-driven messaging enables Windows to tell a compelling story backed by measurable performance data. By pairing customer messages with specific benchmarks, we can validate claims, build developer trust, position WinML as the unifying platform layer, and drive competitive differentiation through power efficiency, cross-device flexibility, and enterprise readiness.
